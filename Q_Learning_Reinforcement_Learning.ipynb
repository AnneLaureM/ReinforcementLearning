        "\n",
        "## **Introduction**\n",
        "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning approach where an agent learns to make optimal decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent follows a trial-and-error process, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions, ultimately aiming to maximize long-term rewards.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q-Learning in Pathfinding and Maze Navigation**\n",
        "One application of RL is **maze navigation and pathfinding**, where an agent (e.g., a robot or an AI character) must reach a target while avoiding obstacles. The agent's **goal** is to find the most efficient path using **Q-learning**, a model-free RL algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **State**: The agent's position in a grid or graph.\n",
        "- **Actions**: Possible moves (e.g., up, down, left, right).\n",
        "- **Rewards**: +1 for reaching the goal, -1 for hitting obstacles, 0 otherwise.\n",

        "\n",
        "## **1. Environment: `GraphEnv` Class**\n",
        "The `GraphEnv` class defines the **grid-based environment**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **State space**: Each position `(x, y)` in the **5x5 grid** is a state.\n",
        "- **Action space**: The agent can move `[\"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\"]`.\n",

        "  - If the move is **invalid** (out of bounds), the state remains unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **2. Q-Learning Setup**\n",
        "Several hyperparameters are defined:\n",
        "- `alpha = 0.1` → **Learning rate** (how much new information overrides old values).\n",
        "- `gamma = 0.99` → **Discount factor** (importance of future rewards).\n",
        "- `epsilon = 1.0` → **Exploration rate** (probability of random action).\n",
        "- `epsilon_decay = 0.995` → **Gradual reduction** of exploration.\n",
