# üöÄ Deep Q-Learning for UAV Navigation

## **Overview**
This project implements **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** techniques, specifically **Q-Learning** and **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**, to train an agent for **autonomous navigation in a grid-based environment**. The agent (UAV) learns to move efficiently while avoiding obstacles and maintaining communication constraints.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning approach where an agent learns to make optimal decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent follows a trial-and-error process, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions, ultimately aiming to maximize long-term rewards.

The notebook provides:
- A theoretical introduction to **Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**.
- Implementation of a **custom environment** using `networkx` for graph-based navigation.
- Training an RL agent to navigate and reach a goal optimally.
- Performance evaluation and visualization of the learned policy.

## **Installation**
This project requires **Python 3.8+** and the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib networkx torch gym
```

## **Usage**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Jupyter Notebook**
Launch the notebook and execute each cell in sequence:

```bash
jupyter notebook Q_Learning_Reinforcement_Learning.ipynb
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Modify Parameters**
You can customize:
- **Grid Size:** Change the environment dimensions.
- **Number of Drones:** Increase or decrease the number of UAVs.
- **Training Episodes:** Adjust `num_episodes` to improve learning.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Train the RL Agent**
The training loop will update the **Q-table (Q-Learning)** or **neural network weights (DQN)** over multiple episodes.

## **Understanding the Algorithm**
### **üîπ Q-Learning**
Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the best action for each state using the **Bellman Equation**:

\[
Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( R + \gamma \max Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
\]

Where:
- \(Q(s, a)\) is the **Q-value** for state \(s\) and action \(a\).
- \( \alpha \) is the **learning rate**.
- \( \gamma \) is the **discount factor** for future rewards.
- \( R \) is the **immediate reward**.
- \( \max Q(s', a') \) is the **maximum Q-value of the next state**.

### **üîπ Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**
DQN extends Q-learning by using a **neural network** to approximate the Q-values instead of a lookup table. This allows it to handle **large state spaces**.

## **Results**
### ‚úÖ **Training Performance**
- **Convergence:** The model learns an optimal policy over **2000 episodes**.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:** Initially, the agent explores (`epsilon=1.0`), but gradually starts exploiting learned knowledge (`epsilon_decay=0.995`).

### ‚úÖ **Policy Visualization**
- The trained UAV **avoids obstacles and navigates efficiently**.
- The learned **Q-values guide optimal movement decisions**.
